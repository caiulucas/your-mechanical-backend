# Your Mechanical

This is the API for the Your Mechanical app. In this moment the same is in process
of build. I'll try to update this project in my free time.

Just enjoy :)

Actively maintained, Kong is widely used in production at companies ranging
from startups to Global 5000 as well as government organizations.

## What This Is About?

So, I'm building this aplication to test my skills and learn about typescript.
I'll try to make an app to sign up mechanical workshops and show them in a map
using Node.js to build this backend and React Native to make an mobile app.

## Node Modules

There are the list of the most important modules I'm using in this project.

- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express): One of the most famous web frameworks for node.
- [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm): Is an ORM with a good integration in Typescript.
